'''The Earth''' is and always has been a world that is crossed with lines. Some made by man; roads, cities, countries. Some made by the Earth herself; mountains, rivers, oceans. But there are lines that run deeper, lines cut by something older than the rock it cuts through, dripping power that the Earth herself cannot fold and tame. It bends the lines around it, twisting and braiding the timeline of history amongst itself -- geologic, and human alike -- so closely it cannot be unraveled. 

This is the Braided Earth, in the year of man 2049.
